# SwiftUI-AI-Chat-App
Askly â€“ An AI-powered chat assistant built with SwiftUI for iOS. This project demonstrates how to integrate OpenAIâ€™s API into a native iOS app, featuring a modern chat interface and message persistence.

## ðŸ”‘ Setup API Key

This project uses the **Gemini API** for AI chat responses.  
Since this repo is public, the real API key is not included.  

To run the app locally:

1. Copy the example config file:
   ```bash
   cp Config.plist.example Config.plist
   ```

2. Open Config.plist and replace:
   ```bash
   <string>YOUR_API_KEY_HERE</string>
   ```
   with your actual Gemini API key from Google AI Studio.
